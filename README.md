# Key Features
Real-Time Sign to Text Conversion: Our glove captures sign language gestures and accurately converts them into text using a sophisticated K-means machine learning model. This model ensures precise gesture recognition by clustering similar movements, offering a seamless translation experience.

# Multi-Language Support: 
The project goes beyond simple text conversion. It's equipped to translate the recognized text into multiple languages, ensuring that communication barriers are a thing of the past. Whether you're interacting in a local caf√© or connecting with friends across the globe, our glove speaks your language.

# Text to Speech Output: 
Completing the communication circle, the glove leverages an advanced speech engine to vocalize the translated text. This feature allows users to not just see but hear the translation, enabling conversations even in environments where reading text might be challenging.

Custom Sign Registration: One of the glove's most groundbreaking features is its ability to learn new signs. Users can record custom signs in real-time, and the model updates itself within seconds to include these new gestures. This adaptability makes the glove a continuously evolving tool, tailored to meet the unique needs of its users.
